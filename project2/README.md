- Setup 
- To get an API you have to set up a discord server creating a guild then creating a oauth2 key. Once you have that you go back to discord developer portal to create a token then place your token and guild to an .env file in the same direectory as your bot.py. 
- For your code to work in the command line you need to install python3 then pip install -U discord.py, next install dotenv to read .env by using command pip  install -U python-dotenv. 
- After making the changes to my bot.py I was able to let the user say Hi and the bottom would say something like "Thank for using my bot" or "This will be the greatest bot in history". 
- Remote hosting would be the best option if you don't have access to a server. there are cloud services like heroku that will allow your bot to run 24/7 . I think this solution would work because the only way a bot can keep running is if it has a computer that is continusly running and never turned off.
